# 💼 Job Recommender & Statistics Dashboard – Morocco 🇲🇦

A JavaFX-based application that streamlines the job search process for **students and recent graduates in Morocco** by automating the collection, classification, and analysis of job offers from major Moroccan platforms such as **Emploi.ma, MJob.ma, Rekrute.com**, and more.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The job market in Morocco is rich and diverse but often scattered across several platforms. Manually navigating these websites to find suitable opportunities is both time-consuming and inefficient. This project solves that problem by **scraping job offers**, **analyzing them using Machine Learning**, and **presenting them through a visual dashboard** for both users and administrators.

## 🎯 Objectives

* 🔎 **Automate** the collection of job offers from trusted Moroccan websites
* 🤖 **Classify** job postings using **Text Classification (NLP + ML in Java)**
* 📊 **Analyze** data to extract insights like:

  * Most common skills
  * Frequent job locations
  * Popular contract types
* 🧠 **Answer user queries** such as:

  * "What offers are available in Casablanca?"
  * "Which sectors have the most job openings?"
* 🛠️ Provide an **Admin Dashboard** (for Anapec or HR teams) to:

  * Manage the database (delete/reset site-specific data)
  * Update scraping results
  * Visualize statistics on job trends and user behavior

---

## 🖥️ Features

* 🔧 **Scraping Engine**: Automatically gathers job postings from selected portals
* 📂 **JavaFX Interface**: Clean and modern UI for both users and administrators
* 📊 **Statistical Charts**: Integrated using `JFreeChart`
* 🧪 **Text Classification**: Implemented in Java for categorizing job data (e.g., by domain, contract type)
* 💬 **User Assistant**: Allows users to ask intelligent questions about job offers
* 📈 **Admin Tools**:

  * View average offers per site/day
  * See most frequently asked questions
  * Monitor and control scraping actions
